# psmove-unity5

Plugin for using PSMove as input into Unity 5. This is adapted from the psmove-ue4 plugin and inspired by UniMove.

# Notes

This plugin works for Unity5-64bit in Windows 64-bit (I use 7 and 8.1 Pro) and soon OS X (as soon as I can build the libs).

Working features:

- Position and orientation of multiple controllers.
- Button presses trigger events.
- Trigger-button value (0-255)
- Set vibration (0-255)
- Controller color changes
- Coregistration with the Oculus DK2

Planned features:
- Improving ps3eye camera driver performance
- Integration with psmove windows service/unix daemon
